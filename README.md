 ## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 This project focused on HR attrition analysis, and I had the opportunity to dive deep into the data using Python. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, and I am eager to share a bit about how I approached this project.
 The primary problem or reason for conducting the HR attrition analysis was to identify and understand the key factors influencing employee turnover within the company. By analyzing various attributes such as age, job satisfaction, years with the current manager, work-life balance, and other relevant factors, the goal was to uncover patterns and insights that could help the company develop targeted strategies to improve employee retention. This analysis aimed to address high attrition rates, enhance employee satisfaction, and ultimately create a more stable and productive workforce.

## Starting the Project:

The project began with a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and other relevant factors. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights related to employee attrition.
